The main motivation behind the development of this library is to provide an easy-to-use framework for the development of complex PDE solvers in a dynamically typed style without sacrificing the performance of statically typed languages. The library currently supports linear and nonlinear PDE systems for scalar and vector fields, single and multi-field problems, conforming and nonconforming finite element discretizations, on structured and unstructured meshes of simplices and hexahedra.","category":"page"},{"location":"#How-to-use-this-documentation-1","page":"Home","title":"How to use this documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The first step for new users is to visit the Getting Started page.\nA detailed description of the software components is available in the Manual page.\nGuidelines for developers of the Gridap project is found in the Gridap wiki page.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Tutorials-1","page":"Home","title":"Tutorials","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In addition to these documentation pages, a set of tutorials written in Jupyter notebooks are available here.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Julia-educational-resources-1","page":"Home","title":"Julia educational resources","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A basic knowledge of the Julia programming language is needed to use the Gridap package.
